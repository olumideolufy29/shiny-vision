All of my open-sourced work for computer vision, stored in this "playground" repository. Most of the code here will be written by me, but some of it may be based on certain tutorials. However, all of the resources that I use when adding to this repository will be updated and listed below when needed.

## Frameworks / Libraries Used
* Scikit-Learn (Python) (Planned)
* OpenCV (Python)

## Resources / Tutorials Used
* OpenCV Documentation
* Google Images (image resources)

## Miscellaneous
* All the programs in this project are written in Python 2.7 only. This is because opencv does not have distributions available for later versions of Python. As such, none of the programs in this project will be written in Python 3.X, nor will they be written in versions prior to 2.7, unless explicitly stated otherwise.
* Instead of a traditional RGB color representation, the programs in this project will revolve around the BGR scale, short for Blue, Green and Red. The reason for this is that OpenCV prefers to represent colors in this manner, and converting between RGB and BGR is an error-prone hassle.
